        <h2>About CodeFusionX</h2>
        <p>CodeFusionX is a web application designed to gather programming files and combine their code into a single text, making it easier to send to a large language model for analysis or processing.</p>
        <p>With CodeFusionX, you can select individual files or entire directories containing programming files, and the application will extract the code from those files and display it in a convenient textbox. You can then copy the combined text to the clipboard or export it as a text file.</p>
        <p>CodeFusionX supports various programming languages and file types, including Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and more. It also provides options to include file names and language-specific comments in the combined text.</p>
        <p>Whether you're a developer, researcher, or anyone working with code, CodeFusionX simplifies the process of gathering and combining code from multiple files, saving you time and effort.</p>
